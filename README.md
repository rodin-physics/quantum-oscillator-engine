To produce the figures in the publication:
- For the Entanglement Engine: 
  1. Run `precomputation.jl` to generate the $\Phi$ matrices
  2. Run `calculations_2D.jl` and `calculations_2Osc.jl` to perform the calculations and create the figures.
- For the 3D Oscillator Engine:
  1. Run the individual files to produce the figures.
